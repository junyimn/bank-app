# Bank application project

<h3> Background </h3>

<p> A small Java project which I decided to work on before starting the Java course in my bootcamp. I've had no prior exprience in coding in Java before, so I really wanted to familarise myself with the language and InteliJ before offically starting Java. I followed a Youtube a tutorial whilst simultaneously making notes and ensuring I understand eveything that is being done. </p>

<h3> About </h3>
